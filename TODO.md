
# Concept

A web framework driven by a RAF (requestAnimationFrame) callback.
Inputs etc would be queued and dispatched to modules that subscribe to them.

It would be driven like a game engine.

default keyboard and mouse modules.
a statemachine class to derive from...

# TODO

+ Started MultiEntity with 2 circles but they are not together and do not move.

+ 

+ Text Elements.

+ More complex movement.

+ Send coordinates into initialize and render so we don't have bounds hardcoded.

+ Something else with the mouse.

+ Create WebGL structure to test.

+ Started reading DOOM source...it has an update to make the skull animate in the menu.  It manages multiple engine modes and has updates for each of them.


# DONE

RequireJS is required.
modularized.

http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#defsimple

+ Create Repository

+ Create configuration file...load it and load the modules based on the configuration file.

+ Start Timestampings each module so we know how much each one takes.

+ We have made screen bigger...the circles should spread out.

+ Cleanup code so defines say what they are.

+ Move Configuration to REST service.
